**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Honestly, the entire domain is interesting to me in general because I've never even realized how data science could be used in science-based domains. However, I found the topic of science-based text extractors interesting because I never realized text extracting could be used for scientific papers.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**  
I would be interested in pursuing an EDA sort of project where we can present data analysis on the findings of our Quarter 2 project work. Also, the current work we are doing has not been the most fruitful as it is difficult with our current data extracting process. It was also difficult with our data collection, which made it even more difficult to start the project.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I think I would change the data collection aspect because from a domain project standpoint I believe we were supposed to replicate the previous quarter's project, but I believe we are making our own database from scratch, which is taking a bit more time.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I think using LLMs are the best techniques we could have used for the project we are currently working on. Also, we are using multiple kinds of LLMs, so it is nice that we cover more than one thing.
